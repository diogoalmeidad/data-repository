## ‚úçüèª Concept Introductions 
 [Google Signals](https://infotrust.com/articles/google-signals-in-google-analytics-4-audience-strategy/): Collect cross-device data from users signed into a Google account. Allows reports on demographics data, cross-device reporting, cross-device remarketing and cross-device conversion exports to Google Ads. On audience creation, allows to use user-data to expand filtering
  Use Cases:

 ## GA4 Data in BigQuery:
-> Google Analytics doesn't export Google Signals data, therefore event data is different between the platform as Google Signals deduplicates user data (user counts and event counts).
